> ## Project Background
Our team read the news about the raising concern regarding Indonesia’s mental health status. According to the latest Riskesdas (Riset Kesehatan Dasar) 2018, that was released by Indonesian health ministry, Indonesia has around 9.8% prevalence in emotional mental health issues, and around 6.1% prevalence in depression. We want to tackle public stigma that no one should be ashamed of having mental issues, therefore we come up by an idea to spread the accessibility to all people in Indonesia. We also want to give information on how to deal with any mental issues, especially anxiety and depression.
